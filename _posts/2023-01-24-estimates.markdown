* Assists in creating a project schedule: With accurate task estimations, managers can create a project schedule that lays out the work that needs to be done and when it needs to be completed.

* Facilitates resource planning: Task estimation helps managers to determine the resources required to complete a task or project, including the number of team members needed and the materials or equipment that will be required.

* Improves communication and collaboration: Task estimation can help to improve communication and collaboration among team members by clearly defining roles, responsibilities and deadlines.

* Increases accountability and visibility: Task estimation can increase accountability by clearly defining what is expected of team members and providing visibility into their progress.

* Enables better decision making: Accurate task estimation allows managers to make better decisions about project priorities, timelines and resource allocation.
